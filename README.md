# Multimodel conversational AI for learning support

This repository presents a structured and comprehensive implementation of core physics concepts related to potential energy, designed as part of a bachelor’s thesis project. The work models gravitational, elastic, and electrostatic potential energy using a well-defined JSON-based structure that integrates theoretical explanations, mathematical formulations, and real-world examples into a single coherent representation. By combining concise descriptions with more detailed conceptual explanations, the repository aims to support different levels of understanding, from introductory learning to more advanced academic study. The inclusion of formulas, illustrative examples, and frequently asked questions allows users to both calculate and reason about potential energy across various physical scenarios, while the structured data format enables reuse in educational software, simulations, or intelligent tutoring systems. Overall, this project serves as a reusable educational resource that bridges traditional physics instruction with modern, data-driven and computational approaches to learning.
